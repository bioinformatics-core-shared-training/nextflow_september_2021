# Nextflow Training Part Two Model Answer

This is my solution to part two of the course. It is not a definitive solution; there is
more than one way of doing some of the work.

This code does not include _bwa_ or _picard_ needed to run the pipeline. These tools are
available from:

1. BWA - https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/
2. Picard - http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/

BWA will need to be built after download and should be installed into this directory.
Picard is Java, so you will need Java 8 or newer on your system and to have the JAR file
available in this directory.
